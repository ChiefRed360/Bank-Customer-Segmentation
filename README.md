Developed a machine learning model that could segment customers of a bank into distinct groups based on their characteristics,
providing insights into consumer behavior patterns. Initiated the project by analyzing the business case to understand the 
impact of customer segmentation on marketing strategies and led the data preparation process using Pandas and NumPy libraries 
in Python to import, clean, and analyze large datasets. Implemented K-means clustering and optimized the model by using the 
elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters, ensuring the most effective segmentation. Enhanced model insights
by applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality for better visualization and interpretation of the clusters.
